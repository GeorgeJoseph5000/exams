# exams

With the rise of COVID-19, Online Tuition became a necessity for students and teachers and kind of a trend, so I tried to create an exams web app with marks and auto-correction. It was great, had much fun creating it. Actually, There was one webpage in which I enjoyed coding the most. It was the "Take Exam" Page, that's because of the big amount of websockets hooked on that page, these sockets always maintain the connectivity with the server during the exam time.
Public exam code to try the website: 123456789
